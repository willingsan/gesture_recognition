# Gesture Recognition
For a Smart TV manufacturing company, a system is required which can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

    Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
    Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
    Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
    Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
    Stop: Pause the movie

## General Information

A Smart TV manufacturing company wants its users to control TV's basic functnalities without a Remote control. All that shall be done using user's gesture which will be monitored by the attached webcam.

## Project Statement

To build a neural network based model which can accurately detect gestures. To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used

Python 3.x, 
Tensorflow 2.16
Keras 3
Google Colab
Google Drive

## Conclusions

- Solutions accuracy is nearly 80% on validation set
- Results largely depend upon the user's surrounding and other effects such as light.
